# Schoology Fixer

This a very simple JS script that fixes some very annoying formatting on Schoology.

## Setup
Make a new bookmark, give it a name, and paste either `bookmarklet.js` or `bookmarklet.min.js` from above into the URL section.

## Usage
When in a Schoology assignment submit screen, go to the "Resources" tab, and click on the bookmark! This will fix the extremely annoying Resources tab, by making it an actually useable size!
